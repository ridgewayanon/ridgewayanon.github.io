    <h3>Governor Matrix Has No Legal Defense For His Corruption</h3>
    <p1>Governor Matrix has no legal defense to his actions aside from arguing that the prosecutor who brought charges against him has no legal authority to do so and that he should be above the law. His actions are grotesque to the rule of law and are blatantly against the employment protections that an at-will termination are not meant to circumvent. His lawsuit against the Attorney General is an attempt to expand his authority and overrule standing common law inscribed by the United States Supreme Court to make himself a dictator over the Executive Branch.<br /><br /></p1>

    <p1>His argument that the Governor is the sole authority on who can work in the Executive Branch is patently false and dangerous if the Court were to accept the argument. It allows for the complete and utter rejection of employment protections if actions are done by an elected tyrant, such as the current incumbent Governor. The Superior Court must reject these claims. Lastly, his attempt to paint the prosecutor as unfair to him is about as ironic as it can get. Was he unbiased and fair when he discharged two hard working members of the National Guard because they criticized him? Was he fair when he started acting superior to everyone because he won a Roblox election? Or does fairness only come into play when it involves him?<br /><br />
    </p1>

    <p1>Governor Matrix, your administration broke the law and unlawfully abused the at-will discharge powers to terminate someone because they stood up against you. This recklessness was caused because you couldn't handle people talking against your choice of Major General and how he is unfit for office. You are why you're in the situation that you're in, and you're dragging your Major General and Brigadier General down with you. History will look down on you as the County Executive and Governor who was indicted in both your terms. All that can be done now is to repent for what you've done, apologize to the parties you've hurt, and seek a plea agreement. For now, the ball is in your court.<br /><br />

	<h3>How Can I Help?</h3>
	<p1>If you want to show Governor Matrix that you disapprove of his administration, please take the time to fill out <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSddIqnZu8yWnHqUhdL3LEbsvDHqGF9JNcu-xzFPIiSHlYIkeQ/viewform?usp=sf_link">this joint approval poll</a> between The Alder Group and The Palmer Times showing that you disapprove of Governor Matrix firing people who call him out.<br /><br />
	</p1>
	
	<p1>Contact State Senators Natedog9982, japan_2s, and Br1452232 and tell them that you want Major General BrandonnLUV and Governor Matrix impeached for corruption and incompetence. These three Senators have remained silent on whether they would support an impeachment of the Governor and Major General. Let them know that you want Governor Matrix to be the first impeached and removed official from office, because it's clear he's not going to do the right thing for us.
