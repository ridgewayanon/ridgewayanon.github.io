    <h3>RELEASE 2: Senator Japan Receives Free Rank In RNG At Governor's Order, Impeachment Vote Corruptly Bought</h3>
    <p1>Just a couple hours ago, Senator Japan_2s was promoted to the rank of Captain as second-in-command of the "Military Department" Staff Unit in the Ridgeway National Guard. You might ask yourself, what is the "Military Department" of RNG? Well, it is a unit that comprises only one person - Senator Japan - and she was given a leadership position because of this newly-established branch in the military. So... free ranking, basically. National Guard Command created a fake unit to falsely promote and inflate the Senator's paycheck using taxpayer dollars. This act, alone, should be enough to call for the impeachment of an incompetently corrupt command who promotes their friends by making up positions that they can occupy.<br /><br /></p1>

    <p1>We talked with a member of Ridgeway National Guard Command who worked under the previous leadership in the Governor largeTitanic2 Administration, who said that this request had been on their desk when they were working for the Ridgeway National Guard. They said that higher ups in the department were against the nepotistic promotion but that Community Manager Aerium and Developer DevGralius had pushed for the promotion. The change was officially rejected under the past administration, but it appears that one of the first changes under Brigadier General RoyaltySyn was to revert that rejection.<br /><br />
    </p1>

    <p1>We censored their name and parts of the conversation to protect the personal privacy of the Command Member and other members of the Ridgeway National Guard. Additionally, we forwarded our conversation and findings to Special Counsel Stickza's Office. We have yet to get a response. We do have Governor Matrix's response:<br /><br />

    <p1>Governor Matrix, when confronted with someone talking about this change, removed their speaking abilities and then removed the abilities of various other people so they couldn't see the chats or changes.<br /><br />
    </p1>

    <img src="/assets/images/evidence/boh-agrees.png">

    <p1>We're glad to see former-Major General bohbazinga agrees with our assessment. We echo his sentiment: what the hell? Why are new units being created to give away promotions for? Well, that's the Matrix_oc way.<br /><br />
    </p1>

    <p1>Senator Japan's recent refusal to impeach Major General BrandonnLUV or Governor Matrix now makes sense: you can't get the free rank and bigger paycheck if you don't hold up your end of the corrupt deal. This quid pro quo deal, likely at the direction of Governor Matrix, has now infected the only body that is meant to politically keep the Governor in check for his actions. Members of the Senate are no longer interested in doing their jobs, but in receiving payment from the Matrix Administration for refusing to advance an impeachment vote. Today, our goals change. We demand the resignations of Governor Matrix, Major General BrandonnLUV, Brigadier General RoyaltySyn, and Senator Japan. Anything less than this is an injustice to the fair administration of justice and a lazy cover up.<br /><br />
    </p1>

    <p1>Senator Japan, you've sold your soul to the Matrix Administration and have tied yourself to a sinking ship for a free rank position in the worst department of Ridgeway. History will look back on your corruption and involvement in the Matrix Administration, but it will not look remorseful on you. Put your politics aside and vote for what is fair in this community. Governor Matrix and Major General Brandon must be impeached for their abuse of the at-will provisions for disciplinary action. Do not sign yourself onto their death wish, put the constituents first.<br /><br />
    </p1>
	
	<h3>How Can I Help?</h3>
	<p1>If you want to show Governor Matrix that you disapprove of his administration, please take the time to fill out <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSddIqnZu8yWnHqUhdL3LEbsvDHqGF9JNcu-xzFPIiSHlYIkeQ/viewform?usp=sf_link">this joint approval poll</a> between The Alder Group and The Palmer Times showing that you disapprove of Governor Matrix firing people who call him out.<br /><br />
	</p1>
	
	<p1>Contact State Senators Natedog9982, japan_2s, and Br1452232 and tell them that you want Major General BrandonnLUV and Governor Matrix impeached for corruption and incompetence. These three Senators have remained silent on whether they would support an impeachment of the Governor and Major General. Let them know that you want Governor Matrix to be the first impeached and removed official from office, because it's clear he's not going to do the right thing for us.
