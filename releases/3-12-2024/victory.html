    <h3>VICTORY: Governor Matrix Indicted For Matrixgate Corruption</h3>
    <p1>Today, the Ridgeway Department of Justice indicted Governor Matrix for Conspiracy to Commit a Crime for his role
      in the violation of state law by Major General BrandonnLUV. A unbiased grand jury of members around the state
      agreed with the Special Counsel that Governor Matrix violated the law when he worked with National Guard Command
      to discharge various service members for speaking out against his administration and his selection of Major
      General. This indictment makes staggering allegations against these officials and unequivocally verify that the
      Governor is corrupt, soft, and ego-driven. The fact that we have even gotten this far shows that he will never win
      a political office again.<br /><br /></p1>

    <p1>Just after we released our initial report, Governor Matrix's legal team issued a statement saying that he "has
      not committed any illegal act, nor does any evidence suggest such." To this date, Governor Matrix asserts that he
      is innocent and that he did not break the law. This assessment is incorrect, false, and
      demonstrates how little the administration knows about the employment powers that are supposed to faithfully
      ensure are protected.<br /><br />
    </p1>

    <p1>An employee of the Government may only be terminated at-will for any reason so long as the reason is not
      prohibited by law. That's to say, that a termination is allowed unless it is illegal by another statute.
      Ridgeway's employment law is not as defined as a real life state, but is much more in-depth compared to other
      jurisdictions on Roblox. So, to demonstrate that this action by Major General Brandon and Brigadier General
      Royalty was illegal, we must show that it was done outside the purposes and general protections of employment law
      in Ridgeway.<br /><br />
    </p1>

    <p1>"Employees should be retained on the basis of adequacy of their performance, inadequate performance should be
      corrected, and employees should be separated who cannot or will not improve their performance to meet required
      standards." 2 R. Stat. ยง 3217. Lastly, employees cannot be fired for "arbitrary action, personal favoritism, or
      coercion for political purposes." 2 R. Stat. ยง 3219(i). In just a precursory glance of the first few lines of
      employment law in Ridgeway, Governor Matrix abused the at-will authority to discharge someone in a manner
      inconsistent with law and the intent of at-will discharge.<br /><br />
    </p1>

    <p1>Governor Matrix, your administration broke the law and unlawfully abused the at-will discharge powers to
      terminate someone because they stood up against you. This recklessness was caused because you couldn't handle
      people talking against your choice of Major General and how he is unfit for office. You are why you're in the
      situation that you're in, and you're dragging your Major General and Brigadier General down with you. History will
      look down on you as the County Executive and Governor who was indicted in both your terms. All that can be done
      now is to repent for what you've done, apologize to the parties you've hurt, and seek a plea
      agreement. For now, the ball is in your court.<br /><br />
