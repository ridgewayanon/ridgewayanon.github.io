    <h3>Matrix is a lot of things, but a good Governor isn't any one of those things.</h3>
    <p1>Throughout his term, Governor Matrix has repeatedly intervened in department affairs to make himself feel like
      an omnipotent God that can control everyone's employment at the click of a button. He has repeatedly made
      decisions to benefit himself or his friends, while hurting the people of Ridgeway that actually play the game and
      work hard for their positions. His administration is rewarded not by good work but by respect and loyalty to
      himself, not to the People of Ridgeway. Countless grievences have turned many members of the community against
      him, and this website aims at compiling all these incidents together.<br /><br /></p1>
    <p1>To anyone that takes the time to read this, we ask you - what if it was you that was fired from your job? What
      if you were essentially banned from playing the game as a cop because you got into an argument with a friend? What
      if you enjoyed playing this game, but some power hungry jerk came along and stripped you of all your hard work
      because you disagreed with how they ran things? How would you react? The common answer is that a person would (and
      very justly, should) speak with contempt against the person that got them removed. That is what this group of
      people is. We are people who have been victimized by the Governor and we aim to make clear that this
      administration is not to be left in the dark, but that their misdeeds will be casted in the light of public
      opinion.<br /><br />
    </p1>
    <p1>In spite of this website, there will still be people that will support the incumbent Governor regardless of what
      evidence, allegations, or objections we make against their elected official. To those people, this website is not
      for you. Our website is for the moderate and reasonable who are able to look at the pictures and assertions we
      make and come to their own well-informed decisions. There very will could be people who review all the assertions
      made here and still walk away supporting the administration, this is understandable. For most people, allegations
      have to meet a specific threshold for them to eventually change their mindset of how they view a person. We may
      not reach that for some people, but for others we will. Our goal, after all, is just to make clear what Governor
      Matrix has done in his few weeks in office.<br /><br />
    </p1>
    <p1><b>TOO LONG, DIDN'T READ -</b> Governor Matrix is power hungry and this website was created to gather all the
      evidence of that together for people to make an informed choice of whether they ought to continue supporting this
      administration.

    <h1>PART ONE: March 5, 2024 Incident</h1>
    <p1><b>March 3, 2024</b><br />Lieutenant Governor mandatorymorale says that they hope Adjutant General BrandonnLUV,
      their administration's nominee to lead the Ridgeway National Guard, would give him special Military Police
      abilities despite not being in the Military Police unit. Brigadier General cream_2s would reject the request,
      calling it unnecessary.</p1>
    <img src="/assets/images/evidence/mandatory-mp.png">
    <img src="/assets/images/evidence/mandatory-regret.png">


    <p1><b>March 5, 2024</b><br />Some time later, the Lieutenant Governor would be discharged as a result of an
      investigation conducted by the
      Military Police. The fruits and causes of this investigation are unknown and inappropriate to release even if this
      organization knew the reasoning for the discharge. Regardless, the fact remains that the Lieutenant Governor was
      to be discharged and terminated from the Ridgeway National Guard.</p1>

    <img src="/assets/images/evidence/rng-discharge.png">

    <p1>It is standard policy for any employee being discharged from the National Guard to be searched of their cars and
      personal property to ensure that all equipment and materials belonging to the National Guard are retained and that
      an employee is not hoarding equipment. This process involves taking the former employee to the Ridgeway State
      Police building in Alder where their cars can be spawned and searched by police. Reportedly, the Lieutenant
      Governor refused to do the search at the Ridgeway State Police building and requested it be done at the Ridgeway
      County Sheriff's Office Substation in Sterling. This request was granted as a courtesy but was outside normal
      procedure.<br /><br /></p1>
    <p1>During the search, the spawn pads were obstructed so the National Guardsman doing the search - Just_Dapper - had
      to move the Lieutenant Governor's car off the spawn pad to resume the searching procedure. To move a car, the
      National Guardsman has to break the window. This is designed by game mechanic and not a decision by policy. So,
      Just_Dapper broke the window of the Lieutenant Governor's car and drove it off the spawn pad.</p1>

    <img src="/assets/images/evidence/busted-window.png">

    <p1>The Lieutenant Governor then began accusing Just_Dapper of vandalism for breaking the window. He would then
      demand a supervisor to report the incident.</p1>

    <img src="/assets/images/evidence/mandatory-accusation.png">
    <img src="/assets/images/evidence/mandatory-supervisor.png">

    <p1>The following screenshots are relevant parts of the conversation that happened immediately following the
      incident involving the broken window.</p1>

    <img src="https://i.gyazo.com/b1a8eecdc76e59d62c8a535663190a44.png">

    <p1>Just two hours after the incident, the Lieutenant Governor would then message Just_Dapper, who also worked as
      the Sergeant-at-Arms for the Senate which the Lieutenant Governor leads, and asked them to justify whether they
      should keep their position within the Senate's staff office.</p1>

    <img src="https://i.gyazo.com/cc7a4b0943a6368340c813b0a01fb452.png">

    <p1>To his credit, the Lieutenant Governor would later apologize to Just_Dapper for the confrontation and would
      display sincere regret. From his message, he retracted the report. This is the only mention he has in this entire
      ordeal and his later apology appears sincere to absolve him of direct involvement of the entire situation.
      However, this incident would prove to be the first spark in a larger fire that has engulfed all of leadership.

  <div style="width: 70%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
    <h1>PART TWO: Confrontation Begins</h1>
    <p1>Brigadier General creamy_2s would privately speak with Just_Dapper about the report that the Lieutenant Governor
      filed on him for the broken window. During this conversation, the Brigadier General revealed that a report was
      filed but that it had no attached evidence. Further, he advised that likely nothing was going to happen with the
      complaint, in their opinion. The existance of this conversation would return to Governor Matrix and the rest of
      his installed National Guard leadership. They would accuse the Brigadier General of leaking classified
      information.<br /><br /></p1>
    <p1>Yes, that was the classified information that was apparently leaked. He leaked the existance of an internal
      misconduct investigation to the person being investigated. Now, it is standard procedure that the subject of any
      investigation be notified of the investigation. So, really, he "leaked" the existance of an investigation to
      someone that should've known about the investigation in the first place and after the report had been retracted by
      the original complainant. How horrible of an offense!<br /><br /></p1>
    <p1>Governor Matrix and Major General BrandonnLUV would then speak with the Brigadier General on the alleged
      leaking. During the call, the Brigadier General stormed out and announce his resignation. Immediately after,
      Governor Matrix would get onto the Brigadier General and tell them that they were summarily fired for leaking
      without an investigation. Governor Matrix would later walk back this order.</p1>

    <img src="/assets/images/evidence/resignation.png">

    <p1>Sometime after the incident with the Brigadier General had occurred, Just_Dapper was placed on administrative
      leave by the Major General. It is important to note that administrative leave can only be used if there is a
      "pending misconduct investigation" where "in extreme cases where the probable punishment of suspension" is high. 2
      R. Stat. § 3127-8. We've already covered that the report filed by the Lieutenant Governor was retracted so there
      shouldn't be any administrative leave on that, and members of the Military Police had reported no other open case
      on Just_Dapper. To venture a guess, it is likely that the incompetence of Governor Matrix and Major General
      Brandon led them to break the law just for retribution. That is just a guess, but seems highly probable.
    </p1>

    <img src="/assets/images/evidence/mpi-confirmation.png">

    <p1>Word got to Just_Dapper that the State Bureau of Investigations was investigating his incident with the
      Lieutenant Governor and that is why he is under administratively leave.</p1>

    <img src="/assets/images/evidence/sbi-investigation.png">
    <img src="/assets/images/evidence/brandon-lies.png">

    <p1>The attorney for Just_Dapper reached out to the Colonel of the State Police to ask about the State Bureau of
      Investigation's investigation into the incident with the Lieutenant Governor. The Colonel responded that no active
      investigation was opened.</p1>

    <img src="/assets/images/evidence/mattcern-investigation.png">

    <p1>To date, no investigator from the Ridgeway State Police or any other civilian law enforcement agency have
      reached out to Just_Dapper, the Brigadier General, or anyone else related to the incident. Again, another lie from
      National Guard Command to justify an illegal administrative leave suspension.</p1>

  <div style="width: 70%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
    <h1>PART THREE: Conclusion</h1>
    <p1>Governor Matrix picked a previously dishonorably discharged soldier who abandoned his post and was blacklisted
      from the Ridgeway National Guard by court order to lead the National Guard. Throughout this entire process, he has
      been involved and supportive of his unqualified friend that has no interest in running the department, but rather
      is interested in dismissing old employees and appointing his friends. Throughout this entire incident, Major
      General Brandon has shown nothing but incompetence and ego-fueled neglect of duty. By enabling his friend,
      Governor Matrix has shown his true color to be vengeful, mean-spirited, and hateful to those who actually do work
      in the State of Ridgeway.</p1>
    <img src="/assets/images/evidence/matrix-timbo1.png">
    <p1>Senator Timbowalk inquired about the resignation/termination of the Brigadier General and rebutted Governor
      Matrix's claim that it was leaking. In response, the Governor threatens the Senator and says that they are "going
      to relay that information." The Senator clarified that they were reaching out as a news investigator on behalf of
      a news company that he owns. What was the Governor's response to transparency-related questions?</p1>
    <img src="/assets/images/evidence/matrix-timbo2.png">
    <p1>To those that say he was not involved and that Brandon was incompetent on his own, this is untrue. Governor
      Matrix has been involved in the process from the very beginning and has even supported it. You'll notice
      throughout the entire discussion so far that First Sergeant mistypro2 has not been mentioned, or at least very
      minamally. You might be asking why she was discharged as well as Just_Dapper. The answer: she stuck up to
      Just_Dapper against Matrix - not Brandon, but Matrix.</p1>

    <img src="/assets/images/evidence/matix-3.png">

    <p1>Shortly afterwards...</p1>

    <img src="/assets/images/evidence/conclusion.png">

    <p1>Governor Matrix is involved in this situation and to claim otherwise is to neglect reality. He has privately
      defended the Major General, has been involved with discussions with National Guard Command, and is actively
      allowing abuse of the law in his administration by his own friends. There is no other conclusion that can be drawn
      from this situation beside that he is stuck up, incompetent, and willfully ignorant of the mistakes he is making.
      There can only be one solution:</p1>

    <h1 style="font-size: 60px; display: block; text-align: center; padding-bottom: 100px;">GOVERNOR MATRIX: RESIGN NOW.
