    <h3>Matrix is a lot of things, but a good Governor isn't any one of those things.</h3>
    <p1>Throughout his term, Governor Matrix has repeatedly intervened in department affairs to make himself feel like
      an omnipotent God that can control everyone's employment at the click of a button. He has repeatedly made
      decisions the benefit himself or his friends, while hurting the people of Ridgeway that actually play the game and
      work hard for their positions. His administration is rewarded not by good work but by respect and loyalty to
      himself, not to the People of Ridgeway. Countless grievences have turned many members of the community against
      him, and this website aims at compiling all these incidents together.</p1>

      of employee demerits on their record.</p1>
